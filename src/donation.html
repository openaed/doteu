<h3>What does OpenAED use donations for?</h3>
<p>OpenAED is hosted on a server that is paid for every month. Besides that, OpenAED has some domain names – openaed.nl,
    openaed.eu, openaed.be, etc. Any excess money is donated to local AED fundraisers.<br><br>

    Here’s an approximate overview of our costs:</p>
