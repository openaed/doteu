<h1>About OpenAED</h1>
<p>OpenAED is an initiative that originated in April 2023. The aim of OpenAED is to provide as complete an overview
    as possible of all AEDs in the Netherlands and, later, Europe. This overview is available through OpenAED’s
    website and API.
    <br><br>
    OpenAED is a non-profit organisation and relies entirely on volunteers. OpenAED’s website and API are free to
    use.
    <br><br>
    OpenAED is an open source project and the source code is available on <a
        href="https://github.com/openaed/openaed">GitHub</a>. Anyone is welcome to contribute.</p>

<h3>OpenStreetMap</h3>

<p>OpenAED uses data from <a href="https://openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap </a>for the locations of and information
    about AEDs. OpenStreetMap is an open source project maintained by volunteers. Would you like to contribute to
    OpenAED? Add AEDs to OpenStreetMap and they will automatically become visible on OpenAED’s map the next
    day.

<h3>Future</h3>
<p>OpenAED’s ambition is to fund, place, and manage AEDs ourselves in the future.</p>
